4.1.4:
The choices for the architecture have been purely based on achieving a high as possible score, losing sight of most other measures,
such as the difference between the performance on the training data and the development set. Unfortunately, although performance is great, 
my system is very overfit to the training data, making it to specific to do that well on the test data.
The used method has been very empirically: try changing one parameter > test it > higher score? leave it there /lower score? undo
By working this way, only one parameter was changed per try, and so several parameters at once was not tested, although they might perform better together than alone.


4.1.5:
see NN_visualisation.pdf
- Not sure about the number of layers, not specified in the script (nr of epochs is the number of loops the system makes over the same network i thought.)
- Not sure about the size of the hidden layer. 2x layer1? layer1!? layer1Â²?
