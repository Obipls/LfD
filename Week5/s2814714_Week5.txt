5.1.1:
Used 50/50 split in trainingdata as development set.
See results.pdf for table of results. 
Accuracy is 0.81, probably low due to small training sample.

5.1.2:
Affecting C seems not to influence the score positively, whether it is increased up till 10, or decreased down till 0.1
C is used for maximization of the margin, making for a broader terrain (the lower C is)around the axis that is not being taken into account.
The larger the C, the larger the penalty for errors.

5.1.3:
RBF scores at least as well as linear, and with altered values does it even better.
(acc. =0.81 with c=1 and gamma =0.7)
It certainly is not oufperformed by the linear kernel.

5.1.4:
Best script uses bigrams and english stopwords build into sklearn.
performs 0,82 accuracy. Best at recall of negative (0,83)
