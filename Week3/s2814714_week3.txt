3.1.1: Python, expected snakes and programming languages, only got snakes.
Olivier ,expected male names, got all French names


3.1.2:
1: Polysemy is the multiple senses that a word can have, which all are related to each other. 
Homonomy is the multiple meanings that a word can have, regardless of the relation between them.
This relation part is the difference between the two, separating a polynym from a homonym.
2: Word embeddings show which words are close to each other, and therefore are likely, but not necesarily, senses for the same word. 
They also can be senses for a different word, that is close to it.

To hard a concept to grasp

Both times cookies comes up first, but with 10% difference in distance.  Maybe because the smaller training set also has less
similar vectors, the size of the total vector space is also smaller.
